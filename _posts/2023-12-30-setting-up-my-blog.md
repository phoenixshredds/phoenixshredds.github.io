# Stepping into the blogosphere

Some nebulous amount of weeks ago I had the idea to create this blog, but since I had no familarity with Ruby and Jekyll, I got sidetracked (monkey brain) and worked on other projects instead. Well, here I am. It's set up, and now I'll be sharing thoughts and projects as I delve deeper into the world of code.

I'll share more soon, but as of now I am working on the JS course at FCC, as well as a couple personal websites (one a portfolio site, and the other a Tecmo Superbowl records site). I also have come up with an idea for a browser RPG (which may or may not include fighting zombies). More soon! Over and out, Jeff.
